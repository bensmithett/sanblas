# Tropical documentation

Tropical is a [template repo](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/), not a library you `npm install` into your existing project.

At its heart, Tropical is just [four core files](#core-files) and some reasonable conventions that provide a foundation for your static site project.

Nothing is hidden away in `node_modules`. Tropical encourages you to read, understand, change and extend your project to suit your needs.
