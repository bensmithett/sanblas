# Quick start

Click the green *Use this template* button [on GitHub](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical) and clone your new repo.

Install dependencies: `yarn` (or `npm install`)

Tropical comes with 3 package scripts:

- `yarn storybook` starts Storybook at http://localhost:9000
- `yarn start` builds the site in `development` mode and serves it at http://localhost:5000
- `yarn build` builds the site in `production` mode into the `output` directory

Start Storybook to build and style your `components`, then use them in MDX or JS files in `pages`. When you're ready, `yarn build` and deploy the `output` folder to your favourite static host!
