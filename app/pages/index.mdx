## What you get

- Build **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** components in **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)**
- **[Fela](http://fela.js.org/)** for atomic CSS-in-JS
- **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** for module bundling & asset revving
- **[Babel](https://babeljs.io/)** for JSX and ES2030
- **[Serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)** for a simple dev server
- **[React Helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet)** for `<head>` management
- Independent **client** and **prerender** entrypoints:
  - **Prerender (**aka **server-render** aka **snapshot):** Build HTML files and other static assets
  - **Client:** Progressively enhance prerendered HTML. Mix and match React components (universal or client-only) with vanilla JS and other libraries
- Everything you need for a **blog:** 
  - Collections
  - A **[JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org/)**
  - **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)** for superpowered Markdown

Tropical is just a [template repo](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/). Not feeling these defaults? **Change them!**

## Why?

Those things are great for some projects. Tropical just has different priorities.

<Feature>🚀 Great performance can be simple.</Feature>

Complex performance optimisations can be useful for some sites and benchmarks, but have their own tradeoffs. Usually the basics are good enough.

<Feature>♻️ Rethink universal JS.</Feature>

Prerendering and rehydration are valuable, but mostly-content websites usually don't need to re-load and re-render the entire page on the client.

<Feature>⚛️ Components are best developed in isolation.</Feature>

Build components in a dedicated [component development environment](https://storybook.js.org/) and drastically simplify your main app's dev server.

<Feature>🧬 Write meaningful, expressive styles & ship atomic classes.</Feature>

All the benefits of atomic CSS. No new <abbr title='Domain Specific Language'>DSL</abbr> to learn.

<Feature>🛠 Prefer a flexible starting point over out-of-the-box functionality.</Feature>

Avoid a configurable black box framework or plugin system. Keep it simple enough to understand and hack directly.

#### Who built this?

Hi there! I'm [Ben](https://www.bensmithett.com/), I've been building websites for a while now. I've worked on industrial-strength static site tooling at [Envato](https://envato.com/) & have experienced enough 💩🐌 internet connections around the world to have opinions about web performance.
