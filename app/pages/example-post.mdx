<!--
Example of a page written in Markdown (MDX) in a .mdx file.

Every page should export a `meta` object with at least a `title` and `description`.
This one also exports a `collection` and `date` to signify it's part of the "posts" collection.
-->
export const meta = {
  title: 'Example Post',
  description: 'An example post written in MDX',
  collection: 'posts',
  date: '2020-11-04'
}

# Your example blog post

You can write your posts and pages in either MDX or JS.

If you remove the `collection` and `date` from this file's `meta`, this will just be a standalone page rather than part of your `posts` collection.

MDX lets you render JSX alongside your Markdown, so you can include custom HTML...

import image from '../components/ExampleComponent/gunayala.jpg'

<figure>
  <img src={image} alt='Guna Yala, Panama' width={400} />
  <figcaption>MDX is pretty cool...</figcaption>
</figure>

... as well as reuse existing components. Note that every page receives the `posts` collection as a prop.

import ExamplePostList from '../components/ExamplePostList/ExamplePostList'

<ExamplePostList posts={props.posts} />

---

Remember, components are only prerendered by default.

If you want to automatically [hydrate](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate) a component on the client, you'll need to import a component wrapped with the `asIsland` higher order component.

import ExampleComponent, { ExampleComponentIsland } from '../components/ExampleComponent/ExampleComponent'

## Prerendered only

<ExampleComponent alertMessage="This component isn't hydrated, so this alert will never be seen" />

## Rehydrated

<ExampleComponentIsland alertMessage="This component is hydrated, so this alert will be seen" />
