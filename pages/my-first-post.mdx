Before the arrival of Europeans, the [Guna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guna_people) wore few clothes and decorated their bodies with colorful designs. When encouraged to wear clothes by the missionaries, they copied these designs in their [molas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mola_(art_form)), which they wore as clothing.

The Guna worship a god named Erragon, whom they believe came and died just for the Guna people. Driven off Panama during the Spanish invasion, the Guna fled to the surrounding 378 islands. Today their chief lives on an island called Acuadup, which means "rock island". Many Guna are hunters and fishermen. On some of the islands, children can attend school. Most of the men now speak [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language), although the women carry on older traditions.
