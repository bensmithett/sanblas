# Hello world

The San Blas Islands of Panama is an `archipelago` comprising approximately 365 islands and cays, of which 49 are inhabited. They lie off the north coast of the Isthmus of Panama, east of the Panama Canal. A part of the comarca (district) [Guna Yala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guna_Yala) along the Caribbean coast of Panama is home to the Guna people.

- San Blas and its surrounding area is a haven for **ecotourism** because of its pristine environs.
- The area is also popular for sailing, `as it is known for` its beauty and lack of hurricanes.
- Notable locations in the Archipelago are:
  - the main capital El Porvenir
  - the densely crowded island village of Carti Sugtupu
  - and the two keys, Cayos Limones, and Cayos Holandeses, both renowned for their clear waters.
- The islands could be rendered uninhabitable by sea level rise in the late 21st century.
