import { Feature } from '../components/markdown/markdown'

## What you get

- Build **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** components in **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)**
- **[Fela](http://fela.js.org/)** for component-centric CSS & generated atomic classes
- **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** for module bundling & asset revving
- **[Babel](https://babeljs.io/)** so you can write JSX and ES2030
- **[Serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve)** for a straightforward dev server
- **[React Helmet Async](https://github.com/staylor/react-helmet-async/)** for `<head>` management
- Independent **client** and **prerender** entrypoints:
  - **Prerender (**aka **server-render** aka **snapshot):** Build HTML files and other static assets
  - **Client:** Progressively enhance prerendered HTML. Mix and match React components (isomorphic or client-only) with vanilla JS and other libraries
- All the ingredients for a **blog:** collections, a **[JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org/)** and **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)** for superpowered Markdown

San Blas is just a [template repo](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/). Not feeling these defaults? **Change them!**

## What you don't get

- Progressive Web App™ 🙅‍♀️
- isomorphic 🙅‍♀️ <small>(not the [automatic full-page kind](https://github.com/bensmithett/sanblas/blob/docs/decisions/003_dont_default_to_full_page_isomophic_react.md) you're used to anyway)</small>
- graphql 🙅‍♀️

## Why?

Those things are great for some projects. San Blas just has different priorities.

<Feature>🚀 Great performance can be simple.</Feature>

Complex performance optimisations can be useful for some sites and benchmarks, but have their own tradeoffs. Often the basics are enough.

<Feature>♻️ Rethink isomorphic JS.</Feature>

Prerendering and rehydration is valuable, but mostly-content websites usually don't need to re-load and re-render the entire page on the client.

<Feature>⚛️ Components are best developed in isolation.</Feature>

Build components in a dedicated [component development environment](https://storybook.js.org/) and drastically simplify the main app's dev server.

<Feature>🧬 Write meaningful, expressive styles & ship atomic classes.</Feature>

All the benefits of atomic CSS. No new <abbr title='Domain Specific Language'>DSL</abbr> to learn.

<Feature>🛠 Prefer a flexible starting point over out-of-the-box functionality.</Feature>

Avoid a configurable black box framework or plugin system. Keep it simple enough to understand and hack directly.

#### Who built this?

Hi there! I'm [Ben](https://www.bensmithett.com/), I've been building websites for a while now. I've worked on the industrial-strength static site tooling behind [Envato Sites](https://sites.envato.com/) and [Milkshake](https://milkshake.app/) & have experienced enough 💩🐌 internet connections around the world to have opinions about web performance.
