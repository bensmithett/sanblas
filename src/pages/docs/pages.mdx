export const meta = {
  title: `Pages`
}

Pages live in `src/pages` and are either `.mdx` or `.jsx` files. Both options can export a `meta` object.

Every page receives two props:

- `meta`: the page's own `meta` object
- `pages`: an object containing all of the site's page components, keyed by pathname

## JSX pages

You can author pages as a plain React component. That component should be the `default` export.

```js
export const meta = {
  title: 'My page title'
}

export default function MyPage () {
  return <div>Hello world</div>
}
```

## MDX pages

See the [MDX docs](https://mdxjs.com/) for the syntax you can use in `.mdx` files.

```
export const meta = {
  title: 'My page title',
  description: 'Description for search engines',
  tags: ['post'],
  date: '2021-04-01'
}

# Hello world

Ahoy there.
```

### Syntax highlighting

Tropical extends MDX using [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) and the provided `<TropicalCodeBlock>` component, as per MDX's [guide](https://mdxjs.com/guides/syntax-highlighting).

Change code block styles in `<TropicalCodeBlock>` either by styling it as you would any other component, or by taking advantage of prism-react-renderer's [themes](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer#theming).

### Image references in MDX

Markdown-style image references won't result in [importing the asset as a URL](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#importing-asset-as-url).

```markdown
![this doesn't work](./photo.jpg)
```

You can either use [Vite's public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory):

```markdown
![This works!](/photo.jpg)

- assumes image is in public/photo.jpg
- image filename isn't hashed for production
```

or (because MDX lets you use JSX) you can just use a regular `import` and `<img>` like you would in a React component:

```
# Hello world

I am Markdown

import photo from './photo.jpg'

</img src={photo} />
```

## Page `meta`

The optionally exported `meta` object can contain any properties you wish or none at all.

If present, the following properties will be used by Tropical (but you're free to use them too).

- `title` *(string)* — used for the page's `<title>` and the JSON Feed item's `title` (if the page appears in the feed)
- `description` *(string)* — used for the page's `<meta name='description'>`
- `tags` *(array of strings)* — the default JSON Feed (`src/feeds/posts.jsx`) only includes pages that include a `'post'` tag
- `Layout` *(component)* — alternative [layout component](/docs/layouts)

### Working with `meta.tags`

Tags are flexible, but one obvious use is creating collections of pages — for example, a date-ordered collection that includes blog posts but not your homepage or "About Us" page.

Tropical provides a `pagesWithTag` helper for this common scenario.

```javascript
import { pagesWithTag } from '../utils'

const blogPosts = pagesWithTag(props.pages, 'post')

<ul>
  {blogPosts.map(({ meta, urlPath }) => (
    <li>
      <a href={urlPath}>{meta.title}</a>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```
