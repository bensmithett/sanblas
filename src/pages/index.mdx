# Tropical

A sensible static site generator for the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) age.

Modern static sites without the magic. Tropical is just [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with a layer of familiar, industry-standard tools & conventions for building *fast*, mostly-just-HTML websites with [islands](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/) of client-side JS.

## Features

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**
- **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)** for superpowered, [syntax-highlighted](https://prismjs.com/) Markdown
- **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)** component development environment
- **[Fela](http://fela.js.org/)** for atomic, *fast*, component-based CSS
- **[Vite's](https://vitejs.dev/)** outrageously fast **[esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)**-powered dev server (with **Hot Module Replacement** and **Live Reload**) and **[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)** build
- **SSR first:**
  - Server-rendered HTML pages by default
  - Optionally sprinkle on browser JS, or adopt the **[Islands Architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture/)** using [tropical-islands](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical-utils/tree/main/packages/tropical-islands) for [partial React hydration](https://markus.oberlehner.net/blog/partial-hydration-concepts-lazy-and-active/)
- All the conventions you need to build a real site or blog: **pages**, **layouts**, and **metadata** like tags and dates
- A **[JSON Feed](https://jsonfeed.org/)**

## Trade-offs

Plain old HTML is 🚀 **blazing fast™**. Tropical lets you use all the powerful, flexible, modern JS tooling you love to build old-fashioned HTML pages with minimal browser JS.

This approach comes with some trade-offs. [All Vite features](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html) are available, and of course you can add libraries and as much browser JS as you need, but by default Tropical doesn't force you to adopt:

- [client-side route transitions](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1186515553285857280) 🙅‍♀️
- [lazy loading](https://www.bensmithett.com/an-argument-against-lazy-loading/) 🙅‍♀️
- code splitting 🙅‍♀️
- Progressive Web App™ and service workers 🙅‍♀️
- [full page hydration](https://github.com/bensmithett/tropical/blob/docs/app/decisions/003_dont_default_to_full_page_react_hydration.md) 🙅‍♀️
- TypeScript 🙅‍♀️
- GraphQL 🙅‍♀️

#### Who built this?

Hi there! I'm [Ben](https://www.bensmithett.com/), I've been building websites for a while now. I've worked on industrial-strength static site tooling at [Envato](https://envato.com/) & have experienced enough 💩🐌 internet connections around the world to have opinions about web performance strategies.
